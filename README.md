- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kbrandon19! I am web developer doing all things creative. My primarily focus is frontend as I enjoy bringing a static design or idea to life! Iâ€™m currently learning Tailwind CSS, improving my Javascript skills!

- ðŸ“« You can find me on Twitter talking about anything and everything or on Instagram showing off my latest creation, both at @MrDebonairFox!
